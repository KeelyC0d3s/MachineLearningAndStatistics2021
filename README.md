# MachineLearningAndStatistics2021 

The purpose of this repository is to house my final project for my Machine Learning and Statistics class as GMIT.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the learning outcomes of the Machine Learning and Statistics Module.
Contained within this repository are two Jupyter Notebooks:

# sci-kitlearn.ipynb
This notebook contains:
1)  A brief overview of Python's sci-kitlearn library
2)  demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms
3)  visualisations of the algorithms to enhance the notebook


# scipy-stats.ipynb
This notebook contains:
1) A brief overview of Python's scipy-stats library
2) An example hypothesis test using ANOVA
3) Appropriate plots and visualisations to enhance the notebook

For both notebooks I have chosen to use the Iris Dataset.
I chose this dataset because 1) I have used it before in a previous project and am familiar with it, and 2) it is conducive for the purposes of both notebooks.



## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook:

1) Open the terminal on your Mac or PC
2) Navigate to the folder where your project is stored
3) Type Jupyter Notebook and press ‘Enter’
4) A browser will appear that will show a .ipynb document
5) Double-click on the .ipynb document and another tab will open with the Jupyter Notebook
6) Begin reading/working in your Jupyter Notebook
